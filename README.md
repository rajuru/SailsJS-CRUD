### Write something scatterdly, get them remembered...

Everyday you create new memories but you forget them soon which you don't want to.
You want to keep a note of them but you don't have time for writing in a tangible diary. Some may ask to use blogs.
But everything you want to store is not that formal for blog. Writing blog needs a formal mindset. Tweeting is too small and even not private.
You want full control about the length and type of what you are going to write so that it doesn't stress you before you start writing.

KheroKhata is for you then.
